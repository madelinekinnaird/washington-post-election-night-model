# Washington Post's Election Night Model 2020

The purpose of this project is to replicate, explore, and better understand the [Washington Postâ€™s 2020 Election Night model](https://github.com/washingtonpost/2020-election-night-model) and prediction intervals more generally. 

I considered three types of models:
- gradient boost regression with prediction intervals
- random forest quantile regression
- conformal quantile regression

My final paper (written somewhat sleep deprived in grad school) on this can be found [here](https://github.com/madelinekinnaird/washington-post-election-night-model/blob/main/memo.pdf), some day when there's time I hope to revisit and correct all of my young and naive errors!
